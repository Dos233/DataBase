The DBMS provides :
a) a security system 
b) an integrity system 
c) a concurrency control system 
d) a recovery control system 
e) a user-accessible catalog

Three Level ANSI-SPARC Architecture :
1. External layer
2. Conceptual layer
3. Internal  layer
From higer level to lower level (1 to 3).If you wanna change the higher level data mode structure, you don't need to change the
lower level.it shows us the feature that the data' independence.

The five components of the DBMS environment:
a) hardware :the date will be stored in hardisk,so if you want to manage the data,the hardware should be necessary
b) software :if you want to easily manage the data and use more function, you should develop or use some softwares(including 
application software.system software(operating system.device driver and utilities))
c) Data 
d) Procedures (A fixed, step-by-step sequence of activities or course of action (with definite start and end points) 
that must be followed in the same order to correctly perform a task.)
e) Database access language : without doubt,if you wanna manipulate your database,you must use the database access language.

The main approaches for managing the design of a database application that has multiple user views :
a)centralized approach :First of all, the requirements of each use are merged into a single set of requirements. And then,
we built a data mode based on the single set of requirements.
b)view integration approach : the local data mode will be built with each
