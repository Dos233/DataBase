Limitation of Enhanced Entity-Relationship model:
Basic concepts of ER modeling are not sufficient to represent requirements of newer, more complex applications.

Most useful additional data modeling concepts of Enhanced ER (EER) model called:
specialization/generalization 
aggregation
composition. 

Response is development of additional ‘semantic’ modeling concepts.


what is generation : combination of many objects.

Two constraints on specification/generation:
a) Partcipation:
mandatory: it has attributes in supperclass,and same attributes in subclass.
optional: it has attributes in supperclass, but not need to be in subclass

b) Disjoint:
1)and:attributes can be in more subclasses
2)or:attributes can be in one subclass

Aggregation: it has "has-a" or "part-of "
compostion: it same as aggregation, but it's strong ownership between entities.
