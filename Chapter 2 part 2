Limitation of Enhanced Entity-Relationship model:
Basic concepts of ER modeling are not sufficient to represent requirements of newer, more complex applications.

Most useful additional data modeling concepts of Enhanced ER (EER) model called:
a) specialization/generalization 
b) aggregation
c) composition. 
a):
specialization:Process of maximizing differences between members of an entity by identifying their distinguishing characteristics. 
Generalization:Process of minimizing differences between entities by identifying their common characteristics. 
Defination:Semantic concepts are incorporated into the original ER model and called the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model.
Response is development of additional ‘semantic’ modeling concepts.


what is generation : combination of many objects.
Superclass/supertype
An entity type that includes one or more distinct subgroupings of its occurrences. 
Superclass/supertype
An entity type that includes one or more distinct subgroupings of its occurrences. 

a) Superclass/subclass relationship is one-to-one (1:1). 
(Each member of a subclass is also a member of the superclass but has a distinct role.)
b) Superclass may contain overlapping or distinct subclasses. 
c) Not all members of a superclass need be a member of a subclass.

Two constraints on specification/generation:
a) Partcipation:
mandatory: it has attributes in supperclass,and same attributes in subclass.
optional: it has attributes in supperclass, but not need to be in subclass
b) Disjoint:
1)and:superclass can be in more subclasses
2)or:superclass can be in one subclass

Aggregation: it has "has-a" or "part-of "
compostion: it same as aggregation, but it's strong ownership between entities.
