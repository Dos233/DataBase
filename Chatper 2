ER mode has(Conceptual mode) :
a) Entity type : must have unique identifiable object (primary ID)
b) Relation type ï¼šcardinality and participation
d) Attribute type
degree of relationship:
Number of participanting entity in the relationship

Relaitonship of degree:
has two :binary relaitonship 
has three : ternary relationship 
has four : quaternary

superclass/supertype: An entity type that includes one or more distinct subclass
subclass/subtype: A distinct subgrouping of occurences of an entity type.
(if two of more objects have different attribute, just make it split to become different subclass)

a)Superclass/subclass relationship is one-to-one (1:1). 
(Each member of a subclass is also a member of the superclass but has a distinct role.)
b)Superclass may contain overlapping or distinct subclasses. 
c)Not all members of a superclass need be a member of a subclass.

what is generation : combination of many objects.

Two constraints on specification/generation:
a) Partcipation:
mandatory: it has attributes in supperclass,and same attributes in subclass.
optional: it may has attributes in supperclass, but not need to be in subclass

b) Disjoint:
1)and:it can be in more subclass
2)or:just can be in one subclass
